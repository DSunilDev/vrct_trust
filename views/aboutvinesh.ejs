              <h3>Tribute by Friends</h3>
            <p>Today morning this group, tribe - the world lost one of the brightest lights it had today. And it is darker that it was yesterday. A light that shone in ways that we couldn’t ever comprehend, and I just watched him in awe, as all of us did, as he lit things up the way he did.  When we would feel like we’d be flickering if that was one of us.</p>
            <p>He is one that has helped shape the very foundations of who we are and by just being himself embodied everything we stood for. Someone who worked harder everyday than all of us; and inspiration like no other. A creator with the wildest skills and human being with the most golden heart and beautiful soul. He touched every single of us in the most unique ways. Just with his energy but also his thoughts and his actions; actions that he so often took, out of his way, to help. His kindness and compassion and just him being; the way he was, he represented the best in us often. And this is not even considering the place he was in.</p>
            <p>He finds himself in a better place today. And that place is better for it. For it gets one of our best.
              And this world is worse off without him. But he too dreamed of a better world with us, and if, when we do make it, it will be dedicated to you Vinesh. </p> 
              <p>He gave us everything he had, like no one else. And I can only promise him that we will do our best in completing a quest we started together, that he was thinking about how to help, till the end.</p>
             <p><b>We love you Vinesh, and you will be missed</b></p> 
             <p><b>May he rest in peace </b></p>
